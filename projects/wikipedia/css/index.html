            <h1>Tiger Sharks</h1>
            <p class="lead"> The <b>tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier)</b> is a species of ground shark, and the only
                extant of the genus Galeocerdo and family Galeocerdonidae. It is a large macropredator, with females
                capable of attaining a length of over 5 m (16 ft 5 in). Populations are found in many tropical and
                temperate waters, especially around central Pacific islands. Its name derives from the dark stripes down
                its body, which resembles a tiger's pattern, but fade as the shark matures </p>
            <p>The tiger shark is a solitary, mostly nocturnal hunter. It is notable for having the widest food spectrum
                of all sharks, with a range of prey that include crustaceans, fish, seals, birds, squid, trutles, sea
                snakes, dolphins, and even other, smaller sharks. It also has a reputatiom as a "garbage eater,"
                consuming a variety of inedible, man-made objects that linger in its stomach. Tiger sharks have only one
                recorded natural predator, the orca. It is considered a near threatned speciaes because of finning and
                fishing by humans.</p>
            <p>The tiger shark is second only to the great white in recorded fatal attacks on humans, but these events
                are still exceedingly rare</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>The tiger shark commonly attains adult length of 3.5 to 4.7 m (11 ft 6 in - 15 ft 5 in) and weighs
                between 300 and 900 kg. The International Game Fish Association's all-tackle record is 810 kg (1,790
                lb). It is sexually dimorphic, with females being the larger sex. Mature females are often over 3.7 m
                (12 ft 2 in) while mature males rarely get that large.Exceptionally large females reportedly can measure
                over 5 m (16 ft 5 in), and the largest males 4 m (13 ft 1 in). Weights of particularly large female
                tiger sharks can exceed 1,300 kg (2,900 lb). One pregnant female caught off Australia reportedly
                measured 5.5 m (18 ft 1 in) long and weighed 1,524 kg (3,360 lb). Even larger unconfirmed catches have
                been claimed. Some papers have accepted a record of an exceptional 7.4-metre (24 ft 3 in),
                3,110-kilogram (6,860 lb) tiger shark, but since this is far larger than any scientifically observed
                specimen, verification would be needed. A 2019 study suggested that Pliocene tiger sharks could have
                reached 8 m (26 ft) in maximum length. There is variation in the speed of growth rates of juvenile tiger
                sharks depending on the region they inhabit, with some growing close to twice as fast as others.


            </p>

            <p> Among the largest extant sharks, the tiger shark ranks in average size only behind the whale shark
                (Rhincodon typus), the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus), and the great white shark (Carcharodon
                carcharias). This makes it the second-largest predatory shark, after the great white. Some other species
                such as megamouth sharks (Megachasma pelagios), Pacific sleeper sharks (Somniosus pacificus), Greenland
                sharks (Somniosus microcephalus), and bluntnose sixgill sharks (Hexanchus griseus) broadly overlap in
                size with the tiger shark, but as these species are comparatively poorly studied, whether their typical
                mature size matches that of the tiger shark is unclear. The great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran), a
                member of the same taxonomic order as the tiger shark, has a similar or even greater average body
                length, but is lighter and less bulky, with a maximum known weight coming from a heavily pregnant 4.4 m
                (14 ft) long individual at 580 kg (1,280 lb).

            </p>
            <p>Tiger shark teeth are unique with very sharp, pronounced serrations and an unmistakable sideways-pointing
                tip. Such dentition has developed to slice through flesh, bone, and other tough substances such as
                turtle shells. Like most sharks, its teeth are continually replaced by rows of new teeth throughout the
                shark's life. Relative to the shark's size, tiger shark teeth are considerably shorter than those of a
                great white shark, but they are nearly as broad as the root as the great white's teeth and are arguably
                better suited to slicing through hard-surfaced prey.[26][27]

            </p>
            <p>A tiger shark generally has long fins to provide lift as the shark maneuvers through water, while the
                long upper tail provides bursts of speed. The tiger shark normally swims using small body movements.

            </p>


            <h3>Vision</h3>

            <p>Sharks do not have moveable upper or lower eyelids, but the shark-among other sharks-has a nicitating
                membrane, a clear eyelid that can cover the eye. A reflective layer behind the sharks retina, called the
                tapetum lacidum, allows light-sensing cells a sencond chance to capture photons of visible light. This
                enhances vision in low-light conditions. </p>

            <h3>Skin</h3>
            <p>The skin of a tiger shark can typically range from blue to light green with a white or light-yellow
                underbelly. The advantage of this is that when it is hunting for its prey, when prey looks at the shark
                from above, the shark will be camouflaged, since the water below is darker. When prey is below the shark
                and looks up the light underbelly will also camouflage the shark with the sunlight. This is known as
                countershading. Dark spots and stripes are most visible in young sharks and fade as the shark matures.
                Its head is somewhat wedge-shaped, which makes it easy to turn quickly to one side.[4][29] They have
                small pits on the snout which hold electroreceptors called the ampullae of Lorenzini, which enable them
                to detect electric fields, including the weak electrical impulses generated by prey, which helps them to
                hunt.[26] Tiger sharks also have a sensory organ called a lateral line which extends on their flanks
                down most of the length of their sides. The primary role of this structure is to detect minute
                vibrations in the water. These adaptations allow the tiger shark to hunt in darkness and detect hidden
                prey.[30]

            <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
            <p>The shark was first described by Peron and Lesueur in 1822, and was given the name Squalus cuvier.[3]
                Müller and Henle in 1837 renamed it Galeocerdo tigrinus.[6] The genus, Galeocerdo, is derived from the
                Greek galeos, which means shark, and kerdo, the word for fox.[6] It is often colloquially called the
                man-eater shark.[6]

            </p>
            <img src="images/Tiger_Shark_size.svg.png" alt="Tiger Shark Size">
            <p>The tiger shark is a member of the order Carcharhiniformes, the most species-rich order of sharks, with
                more than 270 species also including the small catsharks and hammerhead sharks.[3] Members of this order
                are characterized by the presence of a nictitating membrane over the eyes, two dorsal fins, an anal fin,
                and five gill slits. It is the largest member of the order, commonly referred to as ground sharks. It is
                the only extant member of Galeocerdo, the only member of the family Galeocerdonidae.[8] The oldest
                remains of Galeocerdo extend back to the Eocene epoch, while the oldest fossils of the modern tiger
                shark Galeocerdo cuvier date to the Middle Miocene, around 13.8 million years ago.[9]

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Distribution and habitat</h3>
        <p>The tiger shark is often found close to the coast, mainly in tropical and subtropical waters throughout the
            world.[6] Its behavior is primarily nomadic, but is guided by warmer currents, and it stays closer to the
            equator throughout the colder months. It tends to stay in deep waters that line reefs, but it does move into
            channels to pursue prey in shallower waters. In the western Pacific Ocean, the shark has been found as far
            north as Japan and as far south as New Zealand.[3] It has also been recorded in the Mediterranean Sea, but
            rarely, off Malaga (Spain), Sicily (Italy) and Libya.[33]

        </p>
        <p> Tiger sharks can be seen in the Gulf of Mexico, North American beaches, and parts of South America. It is
            also commonly observed in the Caribbean Sea. Other locations where tiger sharks are seen include off Africa,
            China, India, Australia, and Indonesia.[4] Certain tiger sharks have been recorded at depths just shy of 900
            m (3,000 ft).[6]

        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction </h2>
        <p>Males reach sexual maturity at 2.3 to 2.9 m (7.5 to 9.5 ft) and females at 2.5 to 3.5 m (8.2 to 11.5 ft).[26]
            Typical weight of relatively young sexually mature specimens, which often locally comprise the majority of
            tiger sharks encountered per game-fishing and scientific studies, is around 80 to 130 kg (180 to 290
            lb).[27][51] Females mate once every three years.[4] They breed by internal fertilization. The male inserts
            one of his claspers into the female's genital opening (cloaca), acting as a guide for the sperm. The male
            uses his teeth to hold the female still during the procedure, often causing the female considerable
            discomfort. Mating in the Northern Hemisphere generally takes place between March and May, with birth
            between April and June the following year. In the Southern Hemisphere, mating takes place in November,
            December, or early January. The tiger shark is the only species in its family that is ovoviviparous; its
            eggs hatch internally and the young are born live when fully developed.[6] Tiger Sharks are unique among all
            sharks in the fact that they employ embrytrophy to nourish their young inside the womb. The young gestate in
            sacks which are filled with a fluid that nourishes them. This allows for the young to dramatically increase
            in size, even though they have no placental connection to the mother.[52]

        </p>
        <p>The young develop inside the mother's body up to 16 months. Litters range from 10 to 80 pups.[6] A newborn is
            generally 51 to 76 cm (20 to 30 in) long.[6] How long tiger sharks live is unknown, but they can live longer
            than 12 years.[4]

        </p>

        <h3>Feeding</h3>
        <p>The tiger shark is an apex predator[34] and has a reputation for eating almost anything.[6] These predators
            swim close inland to eat at night, and during the day swim out into deeper waters.[35] Young tiger sharks
            are found to feed largely on small fish, as well as various small jellyfish, and mollusks including
            cephalopods. Around the time they attain 2.3 m (7.5 ft), or near sexual maturity, their selection expands
            considerably, and much larger animals become regular prey.[36] Numerous fish, crustaceans, sea birds, sea
            snakes,[37] marine mammals (e.g. bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops), common dolphins (Delphinus),[38] spotted
            dolphins (Stenella),[39] dugongs (Dugong dugon), seals and sea lions, and sea turtles (including the three
            largest species: the leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea),[40] the loggerhead (Caretta caretta)[41] and the
            green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas)[36]), are regularly eaten by adult tiger sharks. In fact, adult sea
            turtles have been found in up to 20.8% of studied tiger shark stomachs, indicating somewhat of a dietary
            preference for sea turtles where they are commonly encountered.[42] They also eat other sharks (including
            adult sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus)), as well as rays, and sometimes even other tiger
            sharks.[4][36]

        </p>
        <img src="images/images/Galeocerdo_cuvier_jaws.jpeg" alt="Tiger Shark Jaws">
        <p> Due to high risk of predation, dolphins often avoid regions inhabited by tiger sharks.[43][44] Injured or
            ailing whales may also be attacked and eaten. A group was documented killing an ailing humpback whale
            (Megaptera novaeangliae) in 2006 near Hawaii.[45] A scavenger, the tiger shark will feed on dead whales, and
            has been documented doing so alongside great white sharks.[46]

        </p>
        <p>Evidence of dugong predation was identified in one study that found dugong tissue in 15 of 85 tiger sharks
            caught off the Australian coast.[47] Additionally, examination of adult dugongs has shown scars from failed
            shark attacks.[48] To minimize attacks, dugong microhabitats shift similarly to those of known tiger shark
            prey when the sharks are abundant.[49]

        </p>
        <p>The broad, heavily calcified jaws and nearly terminal mouth, combined with robust, serrated teeth, enable the
            tiger shark to take on these large prey.[43] In addition, excellent eyesight and acute sense of smell enable
            it to react to faint traces of blood and follow them to the source. The ability to pick up low-frequency
            pressure waves enables the shark to advance towards an animal with confidence, even in murky water.[28] The
            shark circles its prey and studies it by prodding it with its snout.[28] When attacking, the shark often
            eats its prey whole, although larger prey are often eaten in gradual large bites and finished over time.[28]

        </p>
        <p> Notably, terrestrial mammals, including horses (Equus ferus caballus), goats (Capra aegagrus hircus), sheep
            (Ovis aries), dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), cats (Felis catus), and brown rats (Rattus norvegicus), are
            fairly common in the stomach contents of tiger sharks around the coasts of Hawaii.[36] In one case, remains
            of two flying foxes were found in the stomach of this shark.[50] Because of its aggressive and
            indiscriminate feeding style, it often mistakenly eats inedible objects, such as automobile license plates,
            oil cans, tires, and baseballs.[4] Due to their habits of eating essentially anything, Tiger sharks are
            often referred to as the "garbage can of the sea".

        </p>
        <h2>Relationship with humans</h2>
        <p>Although sharks rarely bite humans, the tiger shark is reported to be responsible for a large share of fatal
            shark-bite incidents, and is regarded as one of the most dangerous shark species.[56][57] They often visit
            shallow reefs, harbors, and canals, creating the potential for encounter with humans.[4] The tiger shark
            also dwells in river mouths and other runoff-rich water.[6][26] While it ranks second on the list of number
            of recorded shark attacks on humans, behind only the great white shark, such attacks are few and very seldom
            fatal.[6][56] Typically, three to four shark bites occur per year in Hawaii; one notable survivor of such an
            attack is surfing champion Bethany Hamilton, who lost her left arm at age 13 to a tiger shark in 2003. This
            bite rate is very low, considering that thousands of people swim, surf, and dive in Hawaiian waters every
            day.[58] Human interactions with tiger sharks in Hawaiian waters have been shown to increase between
            September and November, when tiger shark females are believed to migrate to the islands to give birth.[59]

        </p>
        <p>On 8 June 2023, a tiger shark attacked and killed a 23-year-old Russian man in the Red Sea off the coast of
            the Egyptian city of Hurghada. The attack was filmed by onlookers and the recording went viral. The shark
            was later captured by fishermen and killed. This was the third fatal tiger shark attack in the area since
            2022.[60]

        </p>
        <p>Between 1959 and 2000, 4,668 tiger sharks were culled in an effort to protect the tourism industry.[where?]
            Despite damaging the shark population, these efforts were shown to be ineffective in decreasing the number
            of interactions between humans and tiger sharks. Feeding sharks in Hawaii (except for traditional Hawaiian
            cultural or religious practices) is illegal,[61][62] and interaction with them, such as cage diving, is
            discouraged. South African shark behaviorist and shark diver Mark Addison demonstrated divers could interact
            and dive with them outside of a shark cage in a 2007 Discovery Channel special,[63] and underwater
            photographer Fiona Ayerst swam with them in the Bahamas.[63][64] At "Tiger Beach" off Grand Bahama, uncaged
            diving with – and even the handling of – female tiger sharks has become a routine occurrence.[65]

        </p>
        <p>Warming Atlantic Ocean currents have caused tiger shark migration paths to move further north, according to a
            University of Miami study.[66]
